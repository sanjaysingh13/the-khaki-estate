"""
Django shell script to clean up demo/test data from The Khaki Estate system.

This script safely deletes:
- Demo maintenance requests and their updates
- Demo bookings and related data
- Demo announcements and their read records
- Demo events and RSVPs
- Demo marketplace items
- Related notifications for the above items

PRESERVES (will NOT delete):
- User accounts and profiles
- System configuration data (NotificationTypes, MaintenanceCategories, AnnouncementCategories)
- Staff assignments and roles
- Common areas and facility definitions

Usage:
    python manage.py shell < cleanup_demo_data.py

Or run interactively in Django shell:
    python manage.py shell
    >>> exec(open('cleanup_demo_data.py').read())
